Getting Started:

-Play til you win, based on luck! Try to get 3 matching symbols across the boards.
-Simple basic concepts, includes a play and a reset button.

Icebox Items:
-Would love to add more interactive bottons, possibly a score section or a bet/points system.
-Would like to have had a chance to get the message to be more animated. Like instead of the "losing" message to just stay on top, still, I would like to have it flash everytime you click the button when you lose. 
-Definitely would like to add sounds to the buttons when clicked, or when you lose/win.
